# Machine-Learning-Project--Cross-Validation
In this project,, i analyzed 3 different datasets. Afer analyzing the datasets, i created two different target columns. After creating the target columns, I used cross validation to determine what machine learning model worked best for this project, between, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression.
